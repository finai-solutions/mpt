- read pairs from disk
- reload token history form hist_prices if it's available in the same daterange.
- implement search algorithm to figure out the date range for available token price history, for example if the token have history starting at 2021-01-01, and start date is 2019-01-01, end date is now, implement search algorithm to figure range of available price history 2021-01-01-now.
- FIX, free coinbase pro api doesn't provide history for some coins beyond 1 year ago, besides some gaps in price history.
